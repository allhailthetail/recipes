### Steps:

1. Wisk _flour & salt_ in large bowl
2. Add _lard, butter_ and cut in with pastry cutter until pea-sized mealy bits
3. Drizzle cold _water_ 1T at a time and stir in with spatula.  **STOP when dough forms large clumps, that's enough!!** 
4. Work on a floured surface, should not be overly sticky.  **Don't overwork the dough** 
5. Halve and form into 1" thick rounds, cover and put in fridge for >= 2hrs < 5 days

> When ready to use, roll it out gently with a floured rolling pin.  Specs of lard still in it is totally normal and to be expected.  
> use the rolling pin to help pick it up and transfer it ot your cast iron pan.  This recipe makes enough for the top lattice-work as well.
